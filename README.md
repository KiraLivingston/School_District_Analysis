# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this challenge is to repeat the school district analysis by disregarding the scores for reading and math at Thomas High School due to questionable integrity of scores.
## Results
How is the district summary affected?
By comparing the two charts, exdluding the Thomas high school scores only minimally affected the math and reading scores averages by tenths of points.  
The school summary shows that both summaries conclude with 90 th percentile passing rates. 
By replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School's performance is barely affected as they are still in the 2nd top five schools in the district. However, the spending is affeced by changing the spending per student from $638.00 to $888.53. Scores by school size and school type are also only slightly affected with no real distinguishing changing characteristics.

## Summary
The four noteable changes in the school district analysis challenge are noteable in the Average Math & Reading scores, % Passing Math and Reading Scores, Ovreall Passing marks, and the Funding for each student.  The largest noteable change is that the funding per student changed, which means the funding per student was changed by almost $200 per student.  Thomas High School's performance ranking however was not changed at all.
